            <br>-process -determine if the ship is in the bounday.
            <br>-process- if it is true put the ship with the start point in row with the size and the new_lettter.
            <br>-return - true for success, false for failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            char is_what(int row_num, char column_letter)
            <br>-input - Number of the row and the letter for the column.
            <br>-process - determine if the point is in the bounday.
